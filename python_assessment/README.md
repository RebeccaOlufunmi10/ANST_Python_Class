4. If the user selects "divide" and the second number is 0, display an error message instead of performing the division.



#### Question 4: Even or Odd CheckerWrite a Python program that:

1. Asks the user to enter a number.
2. Checks if the number is even or odd.
3. Prints ”[number] is even.” if it is even, or ”[number] is odd.” if it is odd.



#### Question 5: Age-based Category CheckerWrite a Python program that:

1. Asks the user to enter their age.
2. Categorizes them based on the following conditions:

**	**•**	**If age is below 13 → Print "You are a child."
